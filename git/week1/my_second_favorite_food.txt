Homemade Mici - The Famous Romanian Garlicky Meat Sausages

If you are a Romanian or have visited Romania, you know what I am saying. If you are not, never visited Romania, or never met a Romanian, then, you must try these delicious little ones aka mici (mititei) immediately.

What is mici or mititei?
They are small homemade sausages with no casing and theyâ€™re so different in many ways, they're super, super nice!

Ideal for a picnic or BBQ especially to grill them and eat them freshly on the spot there and then. They can be pan-fried or baked but.... they will not be the same.

The best mici are the homemade ones obviously as theyâ€™re the real stuff. You know whatâ€™s in them and that is an absolute must as far as I believe. No need to add anything nasty for those to be the â€˜real stuffâ€™. Many people buy them ready-made because they think theyâ€™re too fancy to prepare. They are not. Not at all!!
Keep the recipe simple and youâ€™ll see how beautiful theyâ€™ll turn out.

Traditionally the recipe calls for quite a bit of fat but I have made them with super lean (just 5% fat) pork mince and 5% fat content beef mince. The result?! Simply gorgeous, super juicy, and absolutely delicious mici. A lot healthier too!
But there is not to say that are no secrets to making those little ones, there are!

The secret to making and preparing miciâ€¦.
The fat content, as believed by many, isnâ€™t the actual secret to getting nice juicy mici, not at all.

The very secret to good mici or homemade sausages are a couple of things :

The moisture level - need to add liquids to the mixture (see ingredients)
Soda bicarbonate and the beer (the star ingredients)
Fire (needs to be cooked on fairly rapid-fire) and this is the key to success.
More Important Tips
Fresh minced meat/ground meat is important to get the best-tasting mici;
Mici need and must be cooked on fairly rapid fire and this is to keep them juicy and tender.
Serve immediately as they come off the BBQ;
For the best results, taste, and flavors wise, the mixture needs to rest for a couple of hours in the fridge. No need to rest for more than a couple of hours but if no choice, make the mixture the night before.
Serving Suggestions
traditionally, mici must be served on their own with your favorite mustard and a cold, cold super good pint of beer. Once you have all these in place youâ€™re good to go.
they can be served with chips, bread or buns, or a salad of your choice too (I know I will be told off by a Romanian for saying this lol).

Equipment

glass bowl

spatula

tongs

tray

mug

Ingredients

500 g ground beef (17.7 oz or 2.2 cups) I used 5% fat content
500 g ground pork (17.7 oz or 2.2 cups) I used 5% fat content ( you can use more fat content)
180 ml beef stock (6.09 floz) ideally homemade * see recipe notes
50 ml beer ( 1.69 floz)
1 teaspoon soda bicarbonate * Â½ US teaspoon as that is larger
1 teaspoon salt * â…“ US teaspoon
2-3 cloves garlic (small cloves) grated and made into a paste
1 teaspoon thyme dry or fresh
1 pinch nutmeg (optional)
Â½ teaspoon coriander powder (optional)
Â¼ teaspoon ground cumin (optional)
Â¼ teaspoon ground pepper
Â½ teaspoon cayenne pepper or chilli flakes (optional)
Metric - US Imperial

Instructions

Place the meat into a bowl, you can give it another whizz into the food processor for a double grinding but donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t fancy doing this. There is another solution - extra mixing/kneading.
In a larger mug, I mix the beef stock with beer, soda bicarbonate, spices, salt pepper and give it a good stir until the salt has dissolved entirely.
Add this liquid mixture to the meat and mix really well until the mixture becomes almost a paste. And this is your double grinding technique
You can now work with a dash of oil or water to form the sausages into their shapes. A little touch of oil takes you a long way so just grease your palms with a tiny dash of oil or, use a bit of water. I always use oil. It helps with preventing them from sticking. Place all on a plate or a little tray, something that can easily be placed in the fridge.
Transfer the open sausages to the fridge to rest for 2 to 4 hours but you can leave them overnight too, itâ€™s absolutely okay.
Place them onto a hot, hot grill or in a hot pan and cook them on each side ( x 2) for no longer than 4 min.
Mici must be served with mustard and a super cold glass of beer. HEA VEN!
Notes
Preparing the homemade stock:
To make the beef or lamb stock at home I always choose oxtail or lamb neck and boil these for a good few hours. They can be made separate or mixed it really does not matter.
Meat Combination Ratio 
 If you donâ€™t eat pork replaced this with lamb but if you do, feel free to mix all three types of meat to a ratio of 2:1:1 meaning 2 parts of beef, 1 part pork and 1 lamb. Itâ€™s a sensational one.
Needless to say that I always add chilli flakes to spice things up a little or serve them with nice 'n spicy mustard.
Very Important points/steps! -for the best results
Resting time itâ€™s an important step as they will soak in all the spices and all flavours will blend in nicely.
Mixing the meat is crucial - this needs mixing by hand until resembles a paste
Grilling the mici 
Mici can be grilled, ideally on the charcoal grill but a gas or electric grill would do the job too. They can be even fried in a pan or baked in the oven.
These need to be grilled on quick-fire. High temperature is another secret to PERFECT MICI and turned a couple of times - this is for the best-looking mici (see picture below) but also for delivering some really nice mouthwatering and very juicy mici 'little ones' ðŸ˜‰  
To check whether Mici or the little ones are cooked to perfection while on the grill tap them harder with a fork or the tongs and if they are bouncy, they are ready.
